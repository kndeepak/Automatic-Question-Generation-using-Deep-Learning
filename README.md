Deep Learning - Final Project

END-TO-END QUESTION GENERATION MODEL USING DEEP LEARNING


Assessments play a vital role in education systems, with exams serving as a means to gauge a person's knowledge and skills in various subjects. However, manually crafting questions is a challenging task that demands knowledge, expertise, and resources. Professors invest substantial time in framing questions that align well with the course syllabus. Moreover, certain competitive exams necessitate translating text to ensure unique text comprehension questions.

To address these challenges, our project focuses on automatically translating given text into English and generating a summary. Additionally, we aim to automatically generate multiple-choice questions from the translated and summarized text. We employed transformers with multi-head attention for text translation and an encoder-decoder model with single-head attention for text summarization. Lastly, BERT was utilized to generate keywords, and word-to-vector was used to generate distractors for the multiple-choice questions.
